# Algorithm Design Patterns Library

This repo contains reusable algorithm pattern templates in C++ and Python. Use them to quickly scaffold recursive or dynamic programming solutions by copying and inserting logic.

## Contents

- `dp/` - Dynamic programming (top-down and bottom-up)
- `graphs/` - Graph traversal, topo sort, DP on DAG
- `trees/` - Tree-based DP
- `bitmask/` - Subset problems using bitmasks
- `backtracking/` - Search with pruning

Each file has:
- Clearly marked sections for base/recursive cases
- Classical structure (minimal syntax, clean logic)

This repo will be periodically updated with new content.
